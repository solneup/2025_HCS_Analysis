Analyze HCS crossing events, including 8 by ACE and 8 by PSP. We use PySPEDAS to download data from SPDF. Minimum variance analysis (MVA) and cross product methods are used to transform data to LMN coordinates. Averaged solar wind parameters and HCS widths are obtained for each event. Figures 2, 5, and 6 are plotted by "hcs_figures_final.ipynb."
